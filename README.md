# phys5070FinalProject

The focus of this project is to study quantum systems and their time evolution. The main framework consists of an eigenstate solver for an input potential (numerov.py) and a time evolution state solver (crank_nicolson.py).

The modules are put to work solving for Rabi oscillations, and searching for high harmonic generation in a toy hydrogen model. For full detail, see the Final_Project_BG_MR jupyter notebook.
